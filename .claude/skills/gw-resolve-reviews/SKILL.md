# Resolve PR Reviews Workflow

Resolve all PR comments on the current branch: fetch all review comments and inline comments, search project resources for relevant knowledge, address each comment, push changes, and capture learnings.

## Prerequisites

Check GitHub CLI authentication:

```bash
gh auth status || { echo "Error: Run 'gh auth login' first"; exit 1; }
```

## Input Validation

```bash
# Validate inputs before shell use
validate_branch() {
    [[ "$1" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9/_-]+$ ]] || { echo "Invalid branch name: $1"; exit 1; }
}

validate_number() {
    [[ "$1" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || { echo "Invalid number: $1"; exit 1; }
}

validate_username() {
    [[ "$1" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ ]] || { echo "Invalid username: $1"; exit 1; }
}
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Detect Current PR and Fetch Latest Changes

```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
validate_branch "$BRANCH"

# Fetch latest changes from remote to ensure we have up-to-date review comments
echo "Fetching latest changes from remote..."
git fetch origin "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || echo "Warning: Could not fetch from remote"

# Get PR info in single API call
PR_INFO=$(gh pr view "$BRANCH" --json number,title,state,body 2>/dev/null) || {
    echo "No PR found for branch: $BRANCH"
    echo "Create a PR first with /gw-work"
    exit 1
}

PR_NUM=$(echo "$PR_INFO" | jq -r '.number')
validate_number "$PR_NUM"

PR_TITLE=$(echo "$PR_INFO" | jq -r '.title')

echo "PR #${PR_NUM}: $PR_TITLE"
echo ""
echo "🔄 Refreshing review data from GitHub..."
```

### Step 2: Fetch All Comments

**IMPORTANT:** Always fetch fresh review data from GitHub API to ensure you have the latest feedback.

Gather all types of review feedback:

#### Get Review Comments (Inline Code Comments)

**Note:** GitHub API caches may be stale. Always fetch with explicit API calls.

```bash
# Get all review comments (inline comments on code) with fresh API call
echo "Fetching inline review comments..."
REVIEW_COMMENTS=$(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$PR_NUM/comments --jq '.[] | {id: .id, path: .path, line: .line, body: .body, user: .user.login, created_at: .created_at}' 2>/dev/null)

REVIEW_COMMENT_COUNT=0
if [ -n "$REVIEW_COMMENTS" ]; then
    REVIEW_COMMENT_COUNT=$(echo "$REVIEW_COMMENTS" | jq -s 'length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
    echo ""
    echo "=== Inline Review Comments (${REVIEW_COMMENT_COUNT}) ==="
    echo "$REVIEW_COMMENTS"
else
    echo "✓ No inline review comments"
fi
```

#### Get PR Conversation Comments

```bash
# Get PR conversation comments with fresh data
echo ""
echo "Fetching PR conversation comments..."
PR_COMMENTS=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUM" --json comments --jq '.comments[] | {id: .id, body: .body, author: .author.login, createdAt: .createdAt}' 2>/dev/null)

PR_COMMENT_COUNT=0
if [ -n "$PR_COMMENTS" ]; then
    PR_COMMENT_COUNT=$(echo "$PR_COMMENTS" | jq -s 'length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
    echo ""
    echo "=== PR Conversation Comments (${PR_COMMENT_COUNT}) ==="
    echo "$PR_COMMENTS"
else
    echo "✓ No PR conversation comments"
fi
```

#### Get Review Submissions

```bash
# Get review submissions with their bodies - ALWAYS FETCH FRESH
echo ""
echo "Fetching review submissions..."
REVIEWS=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUM" --json reviews --jq '.reviews[] | {id: .id, state: .state, body: .body, author: .author.login, submittedAt: .submittedAt}' 2>/dev/null)

REVIEW_COUNT=0
if [ -n "$REVIEWS" ]; then
    REVIEW_COUNT=$(echo "$REVIEWS" | jq -s 'length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
    echo ""
    echo "=== Review Submissions (${REVIEW_COUNT}) ==="
    echo "$REVIEWS"

    # Count reviews by state
    CHANGES_REQUESTED=$(echo "$REVIEWS" | jq -s '[.[] | select(.state == "CHANGES_REQUESTED")] | length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
    APPROVED=$(echo "$REVIEWS" | jq -s '[.[] | select(.state == "APPROVED")] | length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
    COMMENTED=$(echo "$REVIEWS" | jq -s '[.[] | select(.state == "COMMENTED")] | length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0")

    echo ""
    echo "Review Status Summary:"
    echo "  - Changes Requested: ${CHANGES_REQUESTED}"
    echo "  - Approved: ${APPROVED}"
    echo "  - Commented: ${COMMENTED}"
else
    echo "✓ No review submissions"
fi

# Calculate total actionable items
TOTAL_ITEMS=$((REVIEW_COMMENT_COUNT + PR_COMMENT_COUNT + REVIEW_COUNT))
echo ""
echo "📋 Total review items to address: ${TOTAL_ITEMS}"

if [ "$TOTAL_ITEMS" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "✅ No review comments to address. PR is clean!"
    exit 0
fi
```

### Step 3: Search Project Knowledge

Before addressing comments, search project resources for relevant solutions and patterns:

#### Search Documented Solutions

```bash
# Search for relevant solutions in docs/solutions/
find docs/solutions -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "<keyword>" {} \; 2>/dev/null

# Parse YAML frontmatter for matching symptoms, tags, or categories
grep -r "symptoms:" docs/solutions/ | grep -i "<keyword>"
grep -r "tags:" docs/solutions/ | grep -i "<keyword>"
```

**Search locations:**
- `docs/solutions/**/*.md` - Documented problem solutions with YAML frontmatter
- Look for matching `symptoms`, `tags`, `category`, `module` in frontmatter

#### Search Skills and Scripts

```bash
# Search skills for relevant workflows
find .claude/skills -name "SKILL.md" -exec grep -l "<keyword>" {} \; 2>/dev/null

# Search scripts for relevant utilities
find .claude/skills -name "*.py" -o -name "*.sh" -exec grep -l "<keyword>" {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

**Search locations:**
- `.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md` - Skill workflows and instructions
- `.claude/skills/**/scripts/` - Utility scripts
- `.claude/skills/**/references/` - Reference documentation

#### Search Project Documentation

```bash
# Search project docs
find docs -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "<keyword>" {} \; 2>/dev/null

# Search README and guidelines
grep -r "<keyword>" README.md CLAUDE.md GUIDELINES.md 2>/dev/null
```

**Search locations:**
- `docs/**/*.md` - Project documentation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project conventions
- `GUIDELINES.md` - Code guidelines

### Step 4: Analyze and Categorize Comments

For each comment, determine:
1. **File/location**: Which file and line the comment refers to
2. **Action required**: What change is being requested
3. **Relevant knowledge**: What documented solutions or patterns apply
4. **Priority**: Address blocking issues first

Create a summary:

```
Comment Analysis:
- Total inline comments: {count}
- Total PR comments: {count}
- Reviews with feedback: {count}

Relevant Knowledge Found:
- docs/solutions/{file}.md: {applicable pattern}
- .claude/skills/{skill}/SKILL.md: {relevant workflow}

Action Items:
1. {file:line} - {summary of requested change} [applies: {knowledge reference}]
2. {file:line} - {summary of requested change}
...
```

### Step 5: Address Each Comment

For each comment that requires action:

1. **Review relevant knowledge** from Step 3
2. **Navigate to the location** (file and line)
3. **Understand the context** of the requested change
4. **Make the change** following documented patterns
5. **Track completion** for the commit message

### Step 6: Verify Pipeline Requirements

Before committing, ensure all pipeline requirements are met:

```bash
# Run tests and coverage verification
echo "Running tests and coverage verification..."
mvn verify -pl core

# Check exit code
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Pipeline verification failed!"
    echo ""
    echo "Common issues:"
    echo "- Tests failing"
    echo "- Coverage below 80% threshold (instruction or branch)"
    echo "- Build errors"
    echo ""
    echo "Fix issues before committing."
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Pipeline requirements met:"
echo "  - All tests passing"
echo "  - Coverage thresholds met (80%+ instruction and branch)"
echo ""
```

**Important Notes:**
- Use `mvn verify` not just `mvn test` - verify includes coverage checks
- JaCoCo enforces 80% instruction and 80% branch coverage on core module
- If coverage fails, add tests for new/modified code
- Check coverage report: `core/target/site/jacoco/index.html`

### Step 7: Commit Changes

After addressing all comments:

```bash
# Stage all changed files
git add <changed-files>

# Commit with descriptive message listing addressed comments
git commit -m "fix: address PR review comments

Addressed feedback:
- {Change 1 from comment}
- {Change 2 from comment}
- {Change 3 from comment}

PR #${PR_NUM}"

git push
```

### Step 8: Reply to Comments (Optional)

For significant changes, reply to the comment threads:

```bash
# Reply to PR conversation
gh pr comment "$PR_NUM" --body "Addressed all review feedback:
- {Change 1}
- {Change 2}
- {Change 3}"
```

### Step 9: Compound Knowledge

After resolving all comments, capture any learnings discovered during the resolution process.

#### Identify Learnings

Check if any of these occurred:
- Discovered a non-obvious gotcha or edge case
- Found a pattern that should be documented
- Encountered a problem that took investigation to solve
- Learned something that would help future reviews

#### Create Solution Document

If learnings are worth documenting, create a solution file:

```bash
# Generate solution doc path
SLUG=$(echo "{topic}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g' | sed 's/--*/-/g' | cut -c1-40)
CATEGORY="{category}"  # logic-errors, runtime-errors, configuration, patterns, etc.
SOLUTION_PATH="docs/solutions/${CATEGORY}/${SLUG}.md"
```

**Solution document template:**

```markdown
---
title: {Descriptive Title}
date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
category: {category}
tags:
  - {tag1}
  - {tag2}
module: {affected-module}
component: {affected-component}
severity: {low|medium|high}
status: resolved
symptoms:
  - "{Error message or observable behavior}"
  - "{Another symptom}"
---

# {Title}

## Problem Summary

{1-2 sentences describing the problem}

## Symptoms

**Error Message:**
```
{actual error message}
```

**Observable Behavior:**
- {what was happening}
- {what was expected}

## Root Cause

{Technical explanation of why this happened}

## Solution

**File:** `{path/to/fixed/file.java}`

**Before (buggy):**
```java
// problematic code
```

**After (fixed):**
```java
// fixed code
```

## Prevention

{How to prevent this in the future}

## Related Issues

- PR: #{PR_NUM}

## Keywords

{searchable terms for finding this solution later}
```

#### Commit Learnings

```bash
git add "$SOLUTION_PATH"
git commit -m "docs: add solution for {topic}

Captured learnings from PR #${PR_NUM} review feedback."

git push
```

### Step 10: Output Results

```
=== Review Resolution Summary ===

PR #${PR_NUM}: ${PR_TITLE}

Comments Addressed: {count}
- Inline code comments: {count}
- PR conversation comments: {count}
- Review feedback: {count}
